# Functions exercises

Create Python functions for the following:

## Without return values
1. Create a function that receives someone's name and prints its amount of characters.
1. Create a function that receives two strings and prints out whether they're identical.
1. Create a function that takes an integer in and displays the times table for that number (from 1 to 12) -- use of for loop.

## With return values
1. Create a function that receives a number, returns True if it's even or False if odd (use modulo for that)
1. Clone and modify the function that receives someone's name so it returns its amount of characters.
1. Clone and modify the function that receives two strings and return whether they're identical or not.
1. Create a set of functions taking two numbers and return the results of the base operations (+ - * /) and create a main program asking for two numbers and an operator. Using if/elif/else do the appropriate operation.
1. Turn last week's [find min / find max](https://github.com/aammeloot/nccdm6-h22376-2019/blob/master/standard_algorithms/find_min-max.py) standard algorithm into a function that takes a list of numbers in and returns the minimum / maximum out.
